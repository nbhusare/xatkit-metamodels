## Unreleased

## [2.0.0] - 2019-12-01

### Added

- *Platform* metamodel now support types for *Action* parameters and *Action* return types. Types are optional, and must refer to a JVM type (e.g. a type loaded from the classpath).
- Added class *RuntimeModel* in *metamodels-utils*, that represents a runtime-level instance of an execution rule. This class is used by the languages' JVM inferrers to compute accessible attributes (*context*, *session*, ...), and should not be instantiated by client code.
- Add attribute `EventInstance#triggeredFrom`  in intent metamodel to store the trace of the platform that triggered an event. This attribute is a *String*, reference to the platform metamodel are not possible in the intent one.
- Add attribute `ExecutionRule#fromPlatform` in execution metamodel to store the *PlatformDefinition clause* (i.e. the platform that have created the event). This attribute allows to filter intents/events based on their provenance, allowing to match the same event from different platforms in multi-messaging platform bots.

### Changed

- *Execution* metamodel now integrates *Xbase* expressions. **This change breaks the public API**: the metamodel doesn't contain *ActionInstance* elements anymore, and major structural changes have been performed to integrate Xbase. 

### Removed

- The ad-hoc expression language defined in the *Common* metamodel has been removed, and replaced by the Xbase integration in the *Execution* and *Platform* metamodels. **This change breaks the public API**: execution models integrating the *common expression language* won't work properly anymore.

## [1.0.0] - 2019-10-10
